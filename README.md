# PerryGPT
*What if ChatGPT were a cat?*

ChatGPT is boring. I want a perry to answer my questions. So I built PerryGPT!

## Demo
Try CatGPT at https://perrygpt.netlify.app/

## How?
The latest in pawtifurcial intelligence, PerryGPT uses a purr-al network and an advanced hairballgorithm to come up with natural-sounding responses.

Not really though, it just returns random "cáº·c".
